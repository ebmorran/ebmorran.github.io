## Claiming requirements
On the details page for every covered benefit, our member site displays a list of requirements for claiming that benefit. I was asked to rewrite some of these claiming requirements to make them more reader-friendly.

## Pharmacy statement modal
Our claims history page doesn't include claim statements for claims directly billed by the pharmacy. We needed an info alert to briefly explain this when clicked.

<!--## Conditional copay explanation-->
<!--Conditional Copay is a version of step therapy we use to offer decreased medication copays to members who have already tried less costly equivalent options. I was asked to rewrite the explanation of Conditional Copay in our drug search. The "Conditional Copay" label appears even if the member's plan does not offer it, so the explanation needed to be framed in hypothetical terms: "if your plan uses Conditional Copay."-->
