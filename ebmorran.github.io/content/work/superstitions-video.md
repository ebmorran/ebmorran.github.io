Every country and culture has its own quirky beliefs. Many Canadians fear the number 13, and in China it's taboo to give a clock as a gift. "6 Crazy Superstitions Around the World" shows six funny superstitions from various regions. This video was a group assignment I completed as a student in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.

Although this was a student project and it's a little rough around the edges, I include it here because it shows my ability to tell a story visually. I've never made a video before &mdash; or since. Despite that, I think it's pretty darn funny, and I'm proud of it!

Read on to find out the process behind this video, what I learned, and what I might do differently next time. 

## Concept & Narrative

The idea to make our video about world superstitions was Myungki's. Her inspiration was the well-known Korean "fan death" myth featured in the video. At first, the concept was to debunk these myths. Instead, I developed the idea into brief, humorous illustrations of their consequences.

Quickly, we realized our group represented five different nations, either by birth or recent ancestry. This happy coincidence suggested our format: each of us would act out a belief from our home or ancestral country.

Along with these five, I wanted to show a sixth, Canadian superstition that would feature the whole group. Yup, this silly video secretly has a heartwarming message: we may come from different countries, but we are all Canadian.

The next challenge was to choose six superstitions that could be distilled into visual sequences of less than 15 seconds. I asked everyone to come up with a few superstitions from their home countries. Using storyboards as a guide, I narrowed down potential choices based on how effectively I could communicate them with few words.

Once we chose the "playoff beard" belief for Canada, I came up with the twist that was the video's punchline: all the other superstitions "work" in the video, so the audience expects us to cheer happily for our winning team. But since we're Leafs fans, we're doomed to be disappointed.

## Production

The video was shot over three days in November 2019. We shot at Myungki's apartment, my apartment, and on the Centennial College campus. I assumed the role of director.

All five of us were new to acting &mdash; but goofy over-acting was part of this video's charm. I think my teammates (and myself!) nailed the wacky facial expressions and exaggerated movements.

One acting tip I learned in class came back to haunt me in the editing: professional actors are aware of time and perform quickly. Amateurs hesitate. Visible examples of this are when Myungki hesitates between sitting up and dying in the Korea segment, or when I hesitate between sitting down, then getting up again the Scotland segment. Editing for time would have been easier had we rehearsed more to get through our beats quickly.

Michael (representing Jamaica) turned out to be talented at ad libs. When we watched the "hockey game," he spontaneously ripped off his fake beard and threw it &mdash; a shot I knew we needed to leave in. When we needed to find a broom for his segment, he grabbed a Swiffer. I found this funnier than a regular broom, and encouraged him to stick with it.

Not having dialogue in the video made production smoother. We didn't have to worry about sound, and we were able to talk and give instructions during filming. In the Jamaica segment, when Myungki is droning on and boring Michael, I sat behind the camera asking her questions. She was answering in Korean so that she could babble without hesitation!

## Editing

My inspiration for tone was weird "how to" videos seen on the subreddit /r/DiWHY. These videos demonstrate (questionable) DIY projects with no dialogue, quirky music and flashy title cards. I wanted to capture that offbeat feeling. 

Although I had no experience with video editing, the job landed in my lap. Considering my other responsibilities, time management became a problem, but I didn't mind being the one to execute my vision. I was also happy for the opportunity to learn to use Adobe Premiere.

In editing, I was severely constrained by the length of the music track. Unfortunately, even after speeding up the footage, not all the jokes had enough time to land. I also heard feedback that the title cards moved too fast to read. I wish I had edited the video first and chosen an appropriate music track afterward, or edited the track to make it longer.

Nonetheless, I think I was successful in capturing the mood I wanted, and I would call this project a qualified success. :slight_smile:
