**Tools used:** Sony digital video camera, Adobe Premiere, Adobe Illustrator.  
**Skills used:** Writing, storyboarding, visual storytelling, video directing, video editing.  

Every country and culture has its own quirky beliefs. Many Canadians fear the number 13, and in China it's taboo to give a clock as a gift. "6 Crazy Superstitions Around the World" shows six of the most unique superstitions from various regions. This video was a group assignment I completed as a student in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.

Although this was a student project and it's a little rough around the edges, I include it here because it shows my ability to tell a story visually. I've never made a video before &mdash; or since. Despite that, I think it's pretty darn funny, and I'm proud of it!

Read on to find out the process behind this video, what I learned, and what I might do differently next time. 

## Concept & Narrative

The idea to make our video about world superstitions was Myungki's. Her inspiration was the well-known Korean "fan death" myth featured in the video. At first, the concept was to debunk the superstitions. Instead, I developed the idea into brief, humorous illustrations of the superstitions' consequences.

Quickly, we realized our group represented five different nations. We had three international students (from Korea, Brazil and India) and two who were born into immigrant families in Canada (from Scotland and Jamaica). This happy coincidence suggested our format: each of us would act out a belief from our home or ancestral country.

Along with these five, I wanted to show a sixth, Canadian superstition that would feature all five of us. Yes, this funny video secretly has a heartwarming message: we may come from different countries, but we are all Canadian.

The next challenge was to choose six interesting superstitions and distill them into video segments of less than 15 seconds. I asked everyone to come up with a few superstitions from their home countries. Using storyboards as a guide, I narrowed down potential choices based on how efficiently I could communicate them with few words. 

<!---Raised in a Scottish-Canadian family, I grew up rolling my eyes at many weird and funny superstitions, but I knew which one I wanted to use: my grandma always scolded me that not even brand-new shoes can go on a table, or else you'll be "eating dirt." Almost immediately I was hit with the humorous image of coming home from buying shoes, only to go online and have my card declined while buying more shoes. 
Myungki, of course, already had her superstition in hand, and luckily it was an easy one to script.  -->

<!---Although Canada has its share of superstitions, it was difficult to find one that seemed to be uniquely Canadian. We settled on the "playoff beard" even though Americans seem to have adopted it too. This let us use the hilarious visual gag where all of us, even the girls, wore bushy fake beards to watch the hockey game.-->

## Production
Professional actors are aware of time and perform quickly
Amateurs hesitate
Example: Myungki hesitates between sitting up and dying. Elizabeth hesitates between sitting down, then getting up
Good point: goofy expressions!
What we’d do differently: rehearse and get our marks down pat
Getting the group together after that first day was VERY difficult
We should have started editing before we had all of our footage
We should have put more effort into scheduling
Our shoots were pretty ad-hoc and unplanned
For most of the superstitions, we didn’t have a list of what we needed
Some of the footage had continuity issues or errors we couldn’t fix
Lesson learned: keep to a schedule, plan in advance, have a list of everything you need to film and film it multiple times!
Ad-libbed elements: the Swiffer broom, the thrown off beard.
In the "broom" segment I sat behind the camera asking Myungki questions so that she'd be speaking continuously. She was answering in Korean so that she could babble without hesitation!
Not having dialogue in the video made things so much easier. It was great not to have to worry about sound at all. We talked constantly throughout filming.


## Editing
- My inspiration was weird "how to" videos from Instagram that demonstrate (questionable) DIY products with no dialogue, quirky music and flashy title cards. I wanted to capture that offbeat feel. 
- In editing, I was severely constrained by the length of the music track. Unfortunately not all the jokes had enough time to land, and I did get feedback that the title cards were too fast to read. I wish I had edited the video first and chosen an appropriate music track afterward, or edited the track to make it longer.
- I didn't realize that the "sped up" feeling of those Insta videos came from low frame rate rather than an actual speed boost!
Since editing was left to the last minute, we didn’t have enough time to get to know our footage to make the judgments needed
Really hard to get it down under 1:45 (length of music track) and include all the title cards
Unable to let the jokes “land” as much as wanted
Why did we do the title cards in Illustrator?! PowerPoint would have been easier and saved time
Next time, we’d start editing earlier, and rely on tools we’re already familiar with
