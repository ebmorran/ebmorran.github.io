**Objective:** Design a holiday drink, cup design and instant app for Starbucks    
**My role:** Strategist, writer

This app was an assignment completed in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.

The holidays are all about sharing, so my partner and I wanted our app to let users send their friends a sweet surprise. We based our concept on the "candygram" tradition, where friends and loved ones send each other messages attached to candy canes. Our secret messages would come attached to a delicious drink in a red-and-white striped cup.

Our app concept would allow a user ("Bob") to buy a voucher for one Starbucks handcrafted beverage, write a secret message, and send the voucher to a friend ("Alyssa"). Alyssa receives a code she can take to Starbucks to redeem for a drink of her choice. The barista scans her code, and the Starbucks drink details sticker will print Bob's holiday message for her cup. Happy holidays!
