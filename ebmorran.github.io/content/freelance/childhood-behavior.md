As every parent and early childhood educator knows, kids aren’t born well-behaved! Kids need
supportive, understanding adult guidance to help them learn to model good behavior and avoid
bad behavior.

Childhood behavior management means teaching kids the values and habits they’ll need to
work in a classroom, get along with others and achieve their goals as they grow. When this is
done with care, it can be one of the most rewarding aspects of your child care career.

Let’s take a look at the importance of childhood behavior management, and 10
effective tips from *Client*’s childcare experts to manage childhood behavior in your preschool or
daycare.

## Why is Childhood Behavior Management Important?

Child behavior management is one of the most important tools you have as a child care provider
to make your classroom a supportive learning environment. Good behavior reduces disruptions
and helps kids stay in sync with you and each other, so everyone is ready for the day’s
activities.

Learning positive behavior is one of the key developmental outcomes that kids can achieve at
your child care center. When each child has the guidance they need to learn how to behave,
they will be poised for success in kindergarten and across their whole lives.

Finally, ensuring good behavior is crucial to maintain the safety and reputation of
your child care business. Behavioral issues in kids can become safety issues or lead to conflict
if left unchecked. Managing childhood behavior and collaborating with parents is the best way to
prevent these problems.

## 10 Early Childhood Behavior Management Strategies

### Encouraging Good Behavior

1. Set Clear Expectations for Behavior (Specific, Observable, Measurable)

When kids know exactly what good behavior means, it’s easy to follow the rules. Unclear
expectations can lead to uncertainty and anxiety &mdash; after all, children will rightly feel it’s unfair to
be disciplined for not following an ambiguous rule.

Remember that kids are still learning about good and bad behavior, so they need lots of specifics:
“be kind to others” might be too abstract for toddlers, but “let everyone take turns” refers to a
real action they can take, and which you can measure objectively.

At the same time, you won’t want to overload kids with so many specific rules they can’t
remember them all. Strike an age-appropriate balance between generality and specificity, and
help kids along by giving them concrete examples and visual aids.

2. Create a Structured Environment with Routines and Schedules

Routines and schedules give kids a sense of security in their environment that leads to
confidence, happiness and good behavior. Uncertainty about what will happen or what to do can
cause anxiety that produces bad behavior, or leave an opening for children to get distracted and
create disruptions.

A visual schedule, reinforced daily, helps kids keep in mind what they’ll need to do next so that
they don’t lose focus during transition times. And routines help guide kids through their daily
actions in fun and memorable ways that get them excited to do what’s asked of them, whether
it’s eating lunch or putting away toys.

3. Consider Situational and Environmental Factors

Good behavior doesn’t happen in a vacuum. When you set kids up for success with your
classroom management skills, you’ll find that half the job of classroom discipline is already
done. A well-organized, harmonious classroom environment reduces stress on kids, and
encourages them to maintain that sense of well-being.

For instance, using an age-appropriate organizational system makes it that much easier for kids
to put away toys. Wise scheduling choices can also make it easy for kids to do their best,
such as not timing quiet activities right before a meal, when kids are naturally
getting antsy.

4. Encourage Good Behavior with Praise and Positive Attention

Kids need to know that doing their best will be rewarded. Positive feedback shows them that
good behavior benefits them too, so they can get excited to be a good member of their daycare
community. Plus, it helps them learn what good behavior looks like in practice, by providing
examples (both in themselves and in other kids) that they can build into a mental model of good
conduct.

Be on the lookout for kids who are cooperating, helping, taking initiative and working to improve
their behavior, and be ready with a smile or a “good job.” Best of all, try to offer specific praise
that acknowledges the child’s efforts &mdash;this really makes kids feel eager to please you again.

5. Create a Reward Menu for Good Behavior

A reward chart or reward menu is a great visual way to reinforce the idea that good behavior in
the classroom matters and is valued. By letting kids visually see how their actions lead to
rewards, you help them get excited to do their best, as well as building the important
developmental skill of learning to make progress toward a goal over time.

### Dealing with Bad Behavior

6. Stay in Control with Rational Detachment

As the adult in the classroom, it’s up to you to maintain control by not getting
angry, defensive or otherwise emotional when bad behavior happens. Projecting these emotions
creates shame, blame and guilt, which can cause children to withdraw or continue their bad
behavior.

Instead, focus on being understanding and compassionate while still reinforcing
age-appropriate consequences. Your guidance and good faith will help kids stay confident that
they are validated and supported, which leads to better outcomes in the long run.

7. Observe and Document Bad Behavior to Understand the Cause

To know how best to address behavioral issues in children, it’s important to record behavior
when it happens. Whether unexpected behavior is a one-off or a recurring issue, taking the time
to document it while your memories are still fresh will help you know why it happened and what
are the appropriate next steps.

Consider what situation led to the behavior, whether it could have been prevented, and what
can be done to most effectively address the behavior given its origin. And with child care
management software, you can have the tools you need at your fingertips to make behavior
reports and track progress over time, so you can identify patterns and make sure you’re meeting
each child’s individual needs.

8. Discourage Mild Misbehavior with Active Ignoring

For kids, attention is a reward in its own right. Often, kids will act out in mild ways out of
boredom or the desire to be noticed. For this type of misbehavior, drawing attention to it can
reinforce the action and create further disruptions.

Actively ignoring mild misbehavior, coupled with consistent reinforcement of positive behavior,
teaches kids that if they want your eyes on them, they’ll have to earn it by trying their best. After
ignoring, be sure to complete the lesson: keep your eye out for the next time you can positively
affirm good behavior in the same child.

9. Establish and Enforce Effective Consequences

While positive reinforcement is the primary way to ensure kids live up to your classroom
expectations, setting consequences is necessary to prevent bad behavior. Kids will understand
and respect your rules when consequences are known in advance, consistently applied and
proportional.

The goal of setting consequences is to help kids make progress toward modeling the behavior
you want to see. To foster that growth, consequences should have a clear connection to the
behavior involved. For instance, if a child is misusing a toy, a natural consequence would be that
he cannot use that toy for the rest of the day.

10. Collaborate with Parents

Parents are a vital ally in guiding kids towards being on their best behavior &mdash;after all, it’s a goal
they share, too! Take advantage of the valuable insights parents can offer from their extended
one-on-one time with their kids: they can help you know how best to respond to behavior in your
classroom.

By working together, you can ensure that your approach to discipline is consistent and effective,
without causing confusion with differing expectations. It’s also a great way to build trust and
nurture relationships with families, by showing them that you’re their partner in helping their
child reach their full potential.
