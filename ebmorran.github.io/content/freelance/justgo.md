## The project

**Assignment:** Design an app for seniors    
**My role:** Strategist, writer  

Social engagement is directly linked to wellbeing in old age, but seniors with difficulty driving face a choice between social isolation and leaving their homes to join retirement communities. justGO is an app that helps seniors engage with their community by providing affordable carpooling services organized for specific seniors' events and activities. This app was an assignment completed in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College. 

## Research

93% of seniors say it's important to keep living in their homes, but 1 in 5 describe their lives as "lonely." Seniors are more likely to die in a car collision, and often face difficulties with driving. The loss of a driver's license, however, can be devastating to a senior's well-being and independence, leading to isolation and lowered quality of life. 

## Concept

&nbsp;

The justGO app invites seniors to join ad-hoc carpool groups to recreational events and activities in their community â€” from grocery trips, to dances, to bingo games, and more. 

The goal of the app is to help seniors age in place and maintain independence by retaining vital community connections. The target demographic is seniors age 70 and older who still live in their homes. (Most retirement communities provide transportation services.)


## Design

### User flow

&nbsp;

### Onboarding screens

&nbsp;

Our onboarding screens clearly explain the concept of the app and let users know that they are only paying for a ride, not the event itself.

### App screens

&nbsp;

The app makes it easy to browse nearby events. Pricing information includes the word "ride" as a reminder that only the ride is included. Information on buying tickets, if required, would be included on each event details screen.
