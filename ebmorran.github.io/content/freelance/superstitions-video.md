Every country and culture has its own quirky beliefs. Many Canadians fear the number 13, and in China it's taboo to give a clock as a gift. "6 Crazy Superstitions Around the World" shows six funny superstitions from various regions. This video was a group assignment I completed as a student in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.

Although this was a student project and it's a little rough around the edges, I include it here because it shows my ability to tell a story visually. I've never made a video before &mdash; or since. Despite that, I think it's pretty darn funny, and I'm proud of it!

Read on to find out the process behind this video, what I learned, and what I might do differently next time. 

## Concept & Narrative

The idea to make a video about world superstitions was Myungki's. Her inspiration was the well-known Korean "fan death" myth featured in the video. At first, the concept was to debunk these myths. I developed the idea into brief, humorous sketches illustrating each supersititon.

Quickly, we realized our group represented five different nations, either by birth or recent ancestry. This happy coincidence suggested our format: each of us would showcase a belief from our home or ancestral country.

The next challenge was to choose six superstitions that could be distilled into visual sequences of less than 15 seconds. I asked everyone to come up with a few superstitions from their countries. Using storyboards as a guide, I narrowed these down based on how effectively they could be shown with few words.

Along with these five, I wanted to show a sixth, Canadian superstition that would feature the whole group. Once we chose the "playoff beard" belief for Canada, I came up with the twist in the punchline: all the other superstitions "work" in the video, so the audience expects us to cheer happily for our winning team. But since we're Leafs fans, we're doomed to be disappointed.

## Production

The video was shot over three days in November 2019. I assumed the role of director.

All five of us were new to acting &mdash; but goofy over-acting was part of this video's charm. I think my teammates (and myself!) nailed the wacky facial expressions and exaggerated movements. But editing for time would have been easier had we rehearsed more to get through our beats quickly.

## Editing

My inspiration for tone was weird "how to" videos seen on the subreddit /r/DiWHY. These videos demonstrate (questionable) DIY projects with no dialogue, quirky music and flashy title cards. I wanted our video to have that offbeat feeling. 

To make the colorful title cards, I learned Adobe Illustrator on the fly. The video was edited with Adobe Premiere.

In editing, I was severely constrained by the length of the music track. Unfortunately, even after speeding up the footage, not all the jokes had enough time to land. I also heard feedback that the title cards moved too fast to read. I wish I had edited the video first and chosen an appropriate music track afterward, or edited the track to make it longer.

But overall, I think I captured the mood I wanted, and I would call this project a qualified success. :slight_smile:
