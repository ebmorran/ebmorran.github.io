**The problem**
As part of onboarding, users upload their passport and immigration documents for manual verification. The original flow had no confirmation or feedback after upload, leaving users uncertain about next steps or wait times. 

**The risk**
Lack of feedback during a high-stakes task (e.g., uploading immigration documents) undermines trust and increases drop-off, support calls, and user frustration. It also fails WCAG's success criterion 3.2.2 (on input: change), which requires that users are informed of state changes.

**My contribution**
I proposed three contextual banner messages:

1. **After upload**
   "We received your documents. You'll get an email when we're done reviewing them."

2. **If review is successful**
   "We verified your documents and it's time to make a one-time wire transfer to your new account. Select "Download wire transfer instructions" to continue."

3. **If review fails**
   "We couldn't verify your documents. Please upload your passport and immigration document again to set up your account. If we still can't verify your identity, you can give us your documents at a CIBC Banking Centre when you arrive in Canada."

**Outcome**
The team implemented all three messages. This improved transparency, reduced confusion, and created a more supportive experience during a sensitive step in the immigration process.
