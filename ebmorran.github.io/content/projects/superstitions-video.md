Every country and culture has its own quirky beliefs. Many Canadians fear the number 13, and in China it's taboo to give a clock as a gift. "6 Crazy Superstitions Around the World" shows six of the most unique superstitions from various regions. This video was a group assignment I completed as a student in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.

**Objective:** Create a short "viral video" based on one of the most common viral formats.  
**My role:** Director, scenario writer, editor, actor.  
**Duration:** 1 semester (3 months).  
**Tools used:** Sony digital video camera, Adobe Premiere, Adobe Illustrator.  
**Skills used:** Writing, storyboarding, visual storytelling, video directing, video editing.  

Although this was a student project and it's a little rough around the edges, I want to include it because it shows my ability to tell a story visually, with few words. I've never made a video before &mdash; or since. But I think it's pretty darn funny, and I'm proud of it! Perhaps my next effort will be more polished.

If you're interested, read on to go behind the scenes and learn about the thought process behind this video, what I learned, and what I might do differently next time. 

## Concept

- The initial idea to cover world superstitions was Myungki's. She thought of this based on the well-known Korean "fan death" superstition.
- The initial concept was to debunk the superstitions. I developed the idea into rather illustrating and showcasing the "consequences" of the superstitions in a brief, funny way.
- My inspiration was weird "how to" videos from Instagram that demonstrate (questionable) DIY products with no dialogue, quirky music and flashy title cards. I wanted to capture that quirky feel. 
-- I didn't realize that the "sped up" feeling came from low frame rate rather than an actual speed boost!
- Quickly, we realized that as a group we had 3 international students (from Korea, Brazil and India) and 2 who were children of immigrant families to Canada (from Scotland and Jamaica). This obviously suggested using one superstition from each country!
- Instead of just 5 superstitions, I wanted to feature a 6th -- one from Canada, that would tie us all together. Yes, this funny video secretly has a heartwarming theme: we are all from separate countries, but all of us are Canadian.

## Development

- The next challenge was to choose 6 superstitions that could be distilled into less than 15-second video segments and figure out how to show them off visually.
- I asked everyone to come up with a few superstitions from their home countries -- ideally ones they actually experienced growing up, not just ones they found on Google.
- Raised in a Scottish-Canadian family, I grew up rolling my eyes at many weird and funny superstitions, but I knew which one I wanted to use: not even brand-new shoes can go on a table, or else you'll be "eating dirt." 
- Finding a uniquely Canadian superstition was hard. We settled on the "playoff beard" superstition even though Americans seem to have adopted it as well. (This let us use the hilarious visual gag of all of us, even the girls, wearing bushy fake beards.)
- Out of the superstitions suggested, I tried to see how each could be distilled into a visual narrative. Some were quite easy (fan death), others were difficult to communicate in the very limited time.

## Production

## Editing
- In editing, I was severely constrained by the length of the music track. Unfortunately not all the jokes had enough time to "land," and I did get feedback that the title cards were too fast to read. I wish I had edited the video first and chosen an appropriate music track afterward, or
