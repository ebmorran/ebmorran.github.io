About me and the way I work:

* A word nerd, language oriented. The written word is where I'm most comfortable, learn best, express myself best. I understand the nuances of language and delicate word choices. I can use tiny changes in vocabulary to improve copy. I can proofread at a glance, instantly spotting comma splices, list parallelism errors, typos, misused homophones, etc. I deeply believe that correct language is one of the most important elements of comprehensibility, not to mention brand polish and authority. Deep skill in writing from a lifelong devotion to the written word.

* Not just a writer, a designer, a strategist. Am I a Figma person, do I like making mockups, no. But I think in UX terms. I use not only writing but information architecture. The structure and organization of information is just as important, if not more important than, the written content. One of the most important things I do is identify where words should *not* be. Language is my tool, not my purpose. 

* Clarity from understanding.

* A systems thinker. I understand the big picture, I think holistically, I prioritize. I identify risk. Foresight. Track and maintain things. How will this change in the future? How could it break? 

* Determined to get things done. Unlimited. I think outside the box. I learn things easily that are new to me. I find ways to accomplish what I want to do.

* Always thinking about how things can be better.

* I hate wasted time, whether my own or others'. I love improving processes. I learned to use Github to save developer time. I built automations to save my own and my CS agents' time. I love leveraging technology for this.

* Super techy.

* Making the implicit explicit. I verbalize and articulate things that others don't know how to say. 

* Ownership and accountability. I don't let things slide. I take responsibility for my work. 

* I capture and document information. 

* Dissent

* Well rounded, interested in different subjects. Today you're supposed to nail yourself down to a niche, but that's just not me, and I wouldn't be good at what I do if I were that narrow.
