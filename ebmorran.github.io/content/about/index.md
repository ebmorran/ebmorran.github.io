My aim as a writer is to integrate purpose and insight, illuminating the “what” for the sake of the “why.” In my year as a UX Content Strategist, I’ve leveraged my background in cognitive science to develop user-centric digital content that simplifies complex processes and provides relevant, actionable information.

With a keen eye for clarity and structure, and five years of professional writing experience, I develop effective UI and navigational microcopy, concise and helpful support resources, penetrating user research prompts and persuasive marketing copy.

I'm a really strong writer who is equally enthusiastic about the technicalities of grammar and the principles of effective communication. 

To me, communication is at the heart of UX, so my job doesn't end with words. UX and writing are both fundamentally about effectively organizing information. 

My fundamental is knowledge. Without a basis in facts, without an understanding of the purpose, context and background of what you're writing, what you write is empty air. Playful, cutesy microcopy is all well and good. What I do is distill deep, complex knowledge into something usable.

With an insistence on having data and business logic at the foundation, I take a big-picture, strategic, user-centric approach to all my work. I've been complimented on my ability to create logical user flows and information architecture, and I've given presentations to other departments on the basics of UX writing and design thinking. I'm well-practiced in effective UX research and I'm a huge advocate of using AI to its utmost potential. Finally, I'm always thinking about design ops and content ops. I love efficiency, defining processes, using automations and getting the most possible out of the tools available.

A UX content strategist with a knack for working closely with designers and researchers to develop brand-enhancing, informative content that resonates.

- digging into user understanding with research that draws out insight and refines IA
- simplifying complex instructional and informational content to remove the intimidation factor of dealing with insurance while reducing CS calls by providing self-serve information
- insurance has a reputation for being complex and intimidating, and many people who are insured through work don't choose their own provider - making the relationship more distant. More transparent, informative, human copy contributes to Medavie's image as a caring insurance provider and trusted health care partner. Clarity is more important than anything -- no aloof, stuffy insurance jargon that tells the user to stop asking questions and just saccept the mysteries of coverage.

As a seasoned UX Content Strategist with a deep-rooted passion for purposeful communication, my career is driven by a fundamental belief: knowledge must serve the user. With over five years of professional writing experience and an educational background in cognitive science, I specialize in creating digital content that is not only clear and actionable but also deeply insightful. My approach integrates a meticulous understanding of user needs with strategic data and business logic, ensuring every piece of content—from UI microcopy to complex informational guides—enhances user experience and brand perception.

My work goes beyond mere word crafting: I believe that effective UX and writing are both, in essence, problems of organizing and presenting information. To that end, I've developed user-centric UI elements, navigational aids, and support resources that simplify complex processes, making them more accessible and less intimidating. This is particularly evident in my projects with Medavie Blue Cross, where I've transformed traditionally dense and opaque content into engaging, transparent communications that demystify coverage and foster trust between the provider and the insured.

I'm known for my strong writing skills, underpinned by an enthusiasm for the nuances of grammar and the principles of effective communication. This obsession with words and their impact is a cornerstone of my professional philosophy. Whether it’s conducting penetrating user research, developing persuasive marketing copy, or delivering presentations on UX writing and design thinking, I consistently advocate for content that is not only functional but also meaningful.

In my role, I also emphasize the importance of design ops and content ops, advocating for efficiency and the maximal use of available tools, including AI. My strategic, big-picture thinking enables me to create logical user flows and information architecture that resonate with both users and business goals. As a communicator and strategist, I am committed to removing barriers through clearer communication, enhancing user interaction, and ultimately elevating the user experience to new heights."
