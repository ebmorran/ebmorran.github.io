My name is Elizabeth Morran. Located in Toronto, I've been writing web content for over seven years and designing UX content for over three. Here's a little about me and the way I work.

## Not *just* a writer...
I’m a designer and strategist first, with words as my primary tool. I focus on structure and information architecture as much as language itself, and one of my key skills is knowing where *not* to add words. I think holistically across journeys, catch risks early and anticipate how changes will affect things over time.

## But definitely a writer.
The written word is where I'm most at home. In writing I can articulate what others struggle to express, capturing knowledge so it’s clear and usable. I’m highly attuned to small shifts in vocabulary that strengthen meaning, and I proofread instinctively, spotting errors and inconsistencies at a glance. I deeply believe that correct, precise language is essential to comprehension, brand authority and user trust. 

## An ambitious thinker and doer...
I learn quickly, adapt easily and find ways to make things happen. This portfolio itself is an example: I taught myself Hugo and GitHub to add features like sections and breadcrumbs to my site. I take ownership of my work, hold myself accountable and constantly find ways to improve. And I’m not afraid to challenge assumptions when something can be better.

## With a love of time-saving tools.
I hate wasted time, whether my own or others'. I'm always looking for ways to streamline processes and offload tedium: I’ve learned GitHub to save developer hours updating documentation, built automations to improve customer service team efficiency and used ChatGPT Codex to standardize style and accessibility. That same philosophy extends to the tools I build for users — I aim to create systems that reduce user effort and are easy to maintain.

## Broad, curious and adaptable...
At heart, I'm driven by curiosity and love of learning. My broad interests and wide reading help me make better connections and design stronger solutions. My work benefits from seeing across domains, letting me find patterns and insights others might miss.

## Plus, good to work with.
My collaborative approach builds others up, respects my team's expertise and forms connections between disciplines. I'm never slow to step in when help is needed... and I've been known to bring in homemade pie for my coworkers.
