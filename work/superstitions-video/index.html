Many Canadians fear the number 13, and in China it&rsquo;s taboo to give a clock as a gift. &ldquo;6 Crazy Superstitions Around the World&rdquo; shows six funny superstitions from various regions. This video was a group assignment I completed as a student in the Interactive Media Management program at Centennial College.</p><p>Although this was a student project and it&rsquo;s a little rough around the edges, I include it here because it shows my ability to tell a story visually. I&rsquo;ve never made a video before — or since. Despite that, I think it&rsquo;s pretty darn funny, and I&rsquo;m proud of it!</p><p>Read on to find out the process behind this video, what I learned, and what I might do differently next time.</p><h2 id=concept--narrative>Concept & Narrative</h2><p>The idea to make our video about world superstitions was Myungki&rsquo;s. Her inspiration was the well-known Korean &ldquo;fan death&rdquo; myth featured in the video. At first, the concept was to debunk these myths. Instead, I developed the idea into brief, humorous illustrations of their consequences.</p><p>Quickly, we realized our group represented five different nations, either by birth or recent ancestry. This happy coincidence suggested our format: each of us would act out a belief from our home or ancestral country.</p><p>Along with these five, I wanted to show a sixth, Canadian superstition that would feature the whole group. Yup, this silly video secretly has a heartwarming message: we may come from different countries, but we are all Canadian.</p><p>The next challenge was to choose six superstitions that could be distilled into visual sequences of less than 15 seconds. I asked everyone to come up with a few superstitions from their home countries. Using storyboards as a guide, I narrowed down potential choices based on how effectively I could communicate them with few words.</p><p>Once we chose the &ldquo;playoff beard&rdquo; belief for Canada, I came up with the twist that was the video&rsquo;s punchline: all the other superstitions &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the video, so the audience expects us to cheer happily for our winning team. But since we&rsquo;re Leafs fans, we&rsquo;re doomed to be disappointed.</p><h2 id=production>Production</h2><p>The video was shot over three days in November 2019. We shot at Myungki&rsquo;s apartment, my apartment, and on the Centennial College campus. I assumed the role of director.</p><p>All five of us were new to acting — but goofy over-acting was part of this video&rsquo;s charm. I think my teammates (and myself!) nailed the wacky facial expressions and exaggerated movements.</p><p>One acting tip I learned in class came back to haunt me in the editing: professional actors are aware of time and perform quickly. Amateurs hesitate. Visible examples of this are when Myungki hesitates between sitting up and dying in the Korea segment, or when I hesitate between sitting down, then getting up again the Scotland segment. Editing for time would have been easier had we rehearsed more to get through our beats quickly.</p><p>Michael (representing Jamaica) turned out to be talented at ad libs. When we watched the &ldquo;hockey game,&rdquo; he spontaneously ripped off his fake beard and threw it — a shot I knew we needed to leave in. When we needed to find a broom for his segment, he grabbed a Swiffer. I found this funnier than a regular broom, and encouraged him to stick with it.</p><p>Not having dialogue in the video made production smoother. We didn&rsquo;t have to worry about sound, and we were able to talk and give instructions during filming. In the Jamaica segment, when Myungki is droning on and boring Michael, I sat behind the camera asking her questions. She was answering in Korean so that she could babble without hesitation!</p><h2 id=editing>Editing</h2><p>My inspiration for tone was weird &ldquo;how to&rdquo; videos seen on the subreddit /r/DiWHY. These videos demonstrate (questionable) DIY projects with no dialogue, quirky music and flashy title cards. I wanted to capture that offbeat feeling.</p><p>Although I had no experience with video editing, the job landed in my lap. Considering my other responsibilities, time management became a problem, but I didn&rsquo;t mind being the one to execute my vision. I was also happy for the opportunity to learn to use Adobe Premiere.</p><p>In editing, I was severely constrained by the length of the music track. Unfortunately, even after speeding up the footage, not all the jokes had enough time to land. I also heard feedback that the title cards moved too fast to read. I wish I had edited the video first and chosen an appropriate music track afterward, or edited the track to make it longer.</p><p>Nonetheless, I think I was successful in capturing the mood I wanted, and I would call this project a qualified success. 🙂</p></article></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3"><div class=sticky-sidebar><aside class=toc><h5>Table Of Contents</h5><div class=toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#concept--narrative>Concept & Narrative</a></li><li><a href=#production>Production</a></li><li><a href=#editing>Editing</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-9 p-2"></div></div></div><button class="p-2 px-3" onclick=topFunction() id=topScroll>
